<br>

My current favorite is Go<br>
The language I have most experience with is JS, did all the shenanigans with it, scrappers, bots and stuff<br>
Did React to see what the Hype is about, didn't like it<br>
Learned node and express to try JS outside of browser, didn't like it so I chose GO<br>
Currently learning backend to build a 2D Multiplayer Game<br>
